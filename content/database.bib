  abstract = {Quantifier variance holds that different languages can have unrestricted quantifier expressions that differ in meaning, where an expression is a “quantifier” just in case it plays the right inferential role. Several critics argued that J.H. Harris’s “collapse” argument refutes variance by showing that identity of inferential role is incompatible with meaning variance. This standard, syntactic collapse argument has generated several responses. More recently, Cian Dorr proved semantic collapse theorems to generate a semantic collapse argument against variance. The argument is significantly different from standard collapse, so it requires a new response. Here I clarify and analyze the semantic collapse argument, and explain how variantists can and should respond to it. The paper also includes an appendix showing the difficulties of positing identity variance without quantifier variance. The argument in the appendix has yet to appear in print, but is familiar to specialists.},

This paper is devoted to the entire family. New data is presented illustrating the productivity of the pattern, identifying a generalization delimiting it, and showing that the cousins, too, have the pragmatic effects that have attracted so much attention to at least and at most. To capture the productivity, I present a new decomposition of at least into recombinable parts. Most notable is the at-component (silent in some languages), which takes advantage of the comparison class argument of the superlative to produce the set of possibilities involved in the ignorance implicatures that superlative modifiers are known for. A side-effect is a new view on gradable predicates, accounting for uses like 88 degrees is too hot.},

We argue for the linguistic relevance of this typology by demonstrating that the distribution and interpretation of degree modifiers is sensitive to its two major classificatory parameters: (1) whether a gradable predicate is associated with what we call an open or closed scale, and (2) whether the standard of comparison for the applicability of the predicate is absolute or relative to a context. We further show that the classification of an important subclass of adjectives within the typology is largely predictable. Specifically, the scale structure of a deverbal gradable adjective correlates either with the algebraic part structure of the event denoted by its source verb or with the part structure of the entities to which the adjective applies. These correlations underscore the fact that gradability is characteristic not only of adjectives but also of verbs and nouns, and that scalar properties are shared by categorially distinct but derivationally related expressions.*},

  abstract = {Do numbers exist? Carnap (1956 [1950]) famously argues that this question can be understood in an “internal” and in an “external” sense, and calls “external” questions “non-cognitive”. Carnap also says that external questions are raised “only by philosophers” (p. 207), which means that, in his view, philosophers raise ”non-cognitive” questions. However, it is not clear how the internal/external distinction and Carnap's related views about philosophy should be understood. This paper provides a new interpretation. I draw attention to Carnap's distinction between purely external statements, which are independent from all frameworks, and pragmatic external statements, which concern which framework one should adopt, and argue that the latter express noncognitive mental states. Specifically, I argue that “frameworks” are systems of rules for the assessment of statements, which are utterances of ordinary language sentences. Pragmatic external statements express noncognitive dispositions to follow only certain rules of assessment. For instance, “numbers exist” understood as a pragmatic external statement expresses a noncognitive disposition to use only rules of assessment according to which numbers do exist. Carnap can thereby be understood as proposing a distinctive form of noncognitivism about ontology that is in some respects analogous to norm-expressivism in metaethics.},

  abstract  = {This book reimagines the compositional semantics of comparative sentences using words such as more, as, too, and others. The book's central thesis entails a rejection of a fundamental assumption of degree semantic frameworks: that gradable adjectives like tall lexicalize functions from individuals to degrees, i.e., measure functions.  Alexis Wellwood argues that comparative expressions in English themselves introduceÂmeasure functions; this is the case whether that morphology targets adjectives, as inÂtaller or more intelligent; nouns, as in more coffee, more coffees; verbs, such as run more, jump more; or expressions of other categories. Furthermore, she suggests that expressions that comfortably and meaningfully appear in the comparative form should be distinguished from those that do not in terms of a general notion of measurability: a measurable predicate has a domain of application with non-trivial structure. This notion unifies the independently motivated distinctions between, for example, gradable and non-gradable adjectives, mass and count nouns, singular and plural noun phrases, and telic and atelic verb phrases. Based on careful examination of the distribution of dimensions for comparison within the class of measurable predicates, she ties the selection of measure functions to the specific nature and structure of the domain entities targeted for measurement.Â The book ultimately explores how, precisely, we should understand semantic theories that invoke the nature of domain entities: does the theory depend for its explanation on features of metaphysical reality, or something else? Such questions are especially pertinent in light of a growing body of research in cognitive science exploring the understanding and acquisition of comparative sentences.},

In addition, for the case of bimodal logic, we show that there is a naturally occurring logic that is incomplete with respect to                                                 VV\{{\textbackslash}cal V\}                           -baos, namely the provability logic                                                 GLBGLBGLB                            (Japaridze, 1988; Boolos, 1993). We also show that even logics that are unsound with respect to such algebras do not have to be more complex than the classical propositional calculus. On the other hand, we observe that it is undecidable whether a syntactically defined logic is                                                 VV\{{\textbackslash}cal V\}                           -complete. After these results, we generalize the Blok Dichotomy (Blok, 1978) to degrees of                                                 VV\{{\textbackslash}cal V\}                           -incompleteness. In the end, we return to van Benthem’s theme of syntactic aspects of modal incompleteness.},

This is a substantial generalization of Rautenberg [10] and [11] in which T is assumed to be weakly transitive and A to be finite. We also obtain as a direct consequence a result by Blok [2] that for all cycle-free and finite ALA splits the lattice of normal extensions of K. Although we firmly believe it to be true, we have not been able to prove that if a logic ? splits the lattice of extensions of T then ? is the logic of an algebra finitely presentable over T; in this respect our result remains partial.},

Other applications of canonical rules include a generalization of the Blok–Esakia theorem and the theory of modal companions to systems of multiple-conclusion rules or (unitary structural global) consequence relations, and a characterization of splittings in the lattices of consequence relations over monomodal or superintuitionistic logics with the finite model property.},

  abstract  = {A variable-free, equational logic {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}L{\}}^{\backslash}times{\$}based on the calculus of relations (a theory of binary relations developed by De Morgan, Peirce, and Schr{\"o}der during the period 1864--1895) is shown to provide an adequate framework for the development of all of mathematics. The expressive and deductive powers of {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}L{\}}^{\backslash}times{\$}are equivalent to those of a system of first-order logic with just three variables. Therefore, three-variable first-order logic also provides an adequate framework for mathematics. Finally, it is shown that a variant of {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}L{\}}^{\backslash}times{\$}may be viewed as a subsystem of sentential logic. Hence, there are subsystems of sentential logic that are adequate to the task of formalizing mathematics.},

  abstract = {W. Blok proved that varieties of boolean algebras with a single unary operator uniquely determined by their class of perfect algebras (i.e., duals of Kripke frames) are exactly those which are intersections of conjugate varieties of splitting algebras. The remaining ones share their class of perfect algebras with uncountably many other varieties. This theorem is known as the Blok dichotomy or the Blok alternative. We show that the Blok dichotomy holds when perfect algebras in the formulation are replaced by ?-complete algebras, atomic algebras with completely additive operators or algebras admitting residuals. We also generalize the Blok dichotomy for lattices of varieties of boolean algebras with finitely many unary operators. In addition, we answer a question posed by W. Dziobiak and show that classes of lattice-complete algebras or duals of Scott-Montague frames in a given variety are not determined by their subdirectly irreducible members.},

  abstract = {In this thesis we look at different aspects of the interplay between structural proof theory and algebraic semantics for several non-classical propositional logics. Concretely, we explore connections between proof theory and algebra as they relate to structural sequent and hypersequent calculi for intermediate and substructural logics. Such connections are particularly strong for logics associated with the levels \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{P\}\_3\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{N\}\_2\$ of the substructural hierarchy introduced by Ciabattoni, Galatos, and Terui. Therefore, we investigate different algebraic aspects of these two levels. Among the algebraic aspects considered, completions of lattices and lattice-based algebras take on a prominent role.},

We consider extensions of multi-modal logic S4n augmented with the universal modality. Admissible consecutions form the largest class of rules, under which a logic (as a set of theorems) is closed. We propose an approach based on the context effective finite model property. Theorem 7, the main result of the paper, gives sufficient conditions for decidability of admissible consecutions in our logics. This theorem also provides an explicit algorithm for recognizing such consecutions. Some applications to particular logics with the universal modality are given.},

Consisting of 10 chapters, written by leading experts, this volume discusses Esakia’s original contributions and consequent developments that have helped to shape duality theory for modal and intuitionistic logics and to utilize it to obtain some major results in the area.Beginning with a chapter which explores Esakia duality for S4-algebras, the volume goes on to explore Esakia duality for Heyting algebras and its generalizations to weak Heyting algebras and implicative semilattices. The book also dives into the Blok-Esakia theorem and provides an outline of the intuitionistic modal logic KM which is closely related to the Gödel-Löb provability logic GL. One chapter scrutinizes Esakia’s work interpreting modal diamond as the derivative of a topological space within the setting of point-free topology. The final chapter in the volume is dedicated to the derivational semantics of modal logic and other related issues.},

The properties of combined logics depend on those of their components plus the particular method of combination. The idea of combining modal logics is natural for many applications. The chapter explores the way in which modal logics can be combined and highlights the consequences of combining them. The formation of fusions is the simplest and the most natural way of combining modal logics. The formation of Cartesian products of various structures—vector and topological spaces, algebras—is a standard mathematical way of capturing the multidimensional character of the world. In modal logic, products of Kripke frames are natural constructions allowing it to reflect interactions between modal operators representing time, space, knowledge, or actions. The product construction as a combination method on modal logics is introduced and is used in applications in computer science and artificial intelligence.},

We here deal with the conjecture: the modal algebra A is subdirectly irreducible (s.i.) if and only if the dual frame A* is generated. We show that it is false in general, and that it becomes true under some mild assumptions, which include the finite case and the case of K4. We also prove that a Kripke frame F is generated if and only if the dual algebra F* is s.i. The technical result is that A is s.i. when the set of points which generate the dual frame A* is not of zero measure.},

  abstract  = {Stable logics are modal logics characterized by a class of frames closed under relation preserving images. These logics admit all filtrations. Since many basic modal systems such as K4 and S4 are not stable, we introduce the more general concept of an M-stable logic, where M is an arbitrary normal modal logic that admits some filtration. Of course, M can be chosen to be K4 or S4. We give several characterizations of M-stable logics. We prove that there are continuum many S4-stable logics and continuum many K4-stable logics between K4 and S4. We axiomatize K4-stable and S4-stable logics by means of stable formulas and discuss the connection between S4-stable logics and stable superintuitionistic logics. We conclude the article with many examples (and nonexamples) of stable, K4-stable, and S4-stable logics and provide their axiomatization in terms of stable rules and formulas.},

  abstract = {A deductive system is structurally complete if all of its admissible inference rules are derivable. For several important systems, like the modal logic S5, failure of structural completeness is caused only by the underivability of a passive rule, i.e., a rule whose premise is not unifiable by any substitution. Neglecting passive rules leads to the notion of almost structural completeness, that means, to the derivability of admissible non-passive rules. We investigate almost structural completeness for quasivarieties and varieties of general algebras. The results apply to all algebraizable deductive systems. Firstly, various characterizations of almost structurally complete quasivarieties are presented. Two of them are general: the one expressed with finitely presented algebras, and the one expressed with subdirectly irreducible algebras. The next one is restricted to quasivarieties with the finite model property and equationally definable principal relative congruences, where the condition is verifiable on finite subdirectly irreducible algebras. Some connections with exact and projective unification are included. Secondly, examples of almost structurally complete varieties are provided. Particular emphasis is put on varieties of closure algebras, that are known to constitute adequate semantics for normal extensions of the modal logic S4. A certain infinite family of such almost structurally complete, but not structurally complete, varieties is constructed. Every variety from this family has a finitely presented unifiable algebra which does not embed into any free algebra for this variety. Hence unification is not unitary there. This shows that almost structural completeness is strictly weaker than projective unification for varieties of closure algebras.},

  abstract   = {This is a review of those aspects of the theory of varieties of Boolean algebras with operators (BAO's) that emphasise connections with modal logic and structural properties that are related to natural properties of logical systems.It begins with a survey of the duality that exists between BAO's and relational structures, focusing on the notions of bounded morphisms, inner substructures, disjoint and bounded unions, and canonical extensions of structures that originate in the study of validity-preserving operations on Kripke frames. This duality is then applied to polymodal propositional logics having finitary intensional connectives that generalise the Box and Diamond connectives of unary modal logic. Issues discussed include validity in canonical structures, completeness under the relational semantics, and characterisations of logics by elementary classes of structures and by finite structures.It turns out that a logic is strongly complete for the relational semantics if the variety of algebras it defines is complex, which means that every algebra in the variety is embeddable into a full powerset algebras that is also in the variety. A hitherto unpublished formulation and proof of this is given (Theorem 5.6.1) that applies to quasi-varieties. This is followed by an algebraic demonstration that the temporal logic of Dedekind complete linear orderings defines a complex variety, adapting Gabbay's model-theoretic proof that this logic is strongly complete.},

  abstract = {A new hierarchy of exact unification types is introduced, motivated by the study of admissibility for equational classes and non-classical logics. In this setting, unifiers of identities in an equational class are preordered, not by instantiation, but rather by inclusion over the corresponding sets of unified identities. Minimal complete sets of unifiers under this new preordering always have a smaller or equal cardinality than those provided by the standard instantiation preordering, and in significant cases a dramatic reduction may be observed. In particular, the classes of distributive lattices, idempotent semigroups, and MV-algebras, which all have nullary unification type, have unitary or finitary exact type. These results are obtained via an algebraic interpretation of exact unification, inspired by Ghilardi's algebraic approach to equational unification.},

Our main result establishes that each logic over wK4 is axiomatizable by canonical formulas, thus generalizing Zakharyaschev’s theorem for logics over K4. The key new ingredients include the concepts of transitive and strongly cofinal subframes of weakly transitive spaces. This yields, along with the standard notions of subframe and cofinal subframe logics, the new notions of transitive subframe and strongly cofinal subframe logics over wK4. We obtain axiomatizations of all four kinds of subframe logics over wK4. We conclude by giving a number of examples of different kinds of subframe logics over wK4.},

This property holds, for example, if V is locally finite or if the language is finite. Let v(V) and q(V) denote the lattice of subvarieties and subquasivarieties of V, respectively. We prove that q(V) is modular iff q(V) is distributive iff v(V) satisfies a certain condition where the case in which the language has a constant symbol is “v(V) is a chain or q(V)=v(V).” We give an isomorphism between q(V) and a lattice constructed in terms of v(V). Via this isomorphism we characterize the completely meet irreducible (prime) elements of q(V) in terms of the completely meet irreducible elements of v(V). We conclude the paper with applications to the varieties of Boolean algebras, relatively complemented distributive lattices, Lukasiewicz algebras, Post algebras, complementary semigroups of rankk (xn˜x)-rings, R5 lattices (P-algebras, B-algebras), and monadic algebras.},

Given a variety V of MV-algebras, we say that a quasivariety is a V-quasivariety provided that it generates V as a variety. It turns out that every variety has a least V-quasivariety denoted by QV. Moreover, it is generated as a quasivariety by its free algebra over an infinite set of generators. We obtain a Komori's type characterization of QV for every proper subvariety of MV-algebras. We investigate the order structure of the poset of least V-quasivarieties and we find all minimal quasivarieties among all quasivarieties of MV-algebras different from the class of boolean algebras. Finally, we make some remarks on the logical interpretation of least V-quasivarieties of MV-algebras as structurally complete extensions of the infinite valued Lukasiewicz logic.},

Consequently, stable si-logics are analogues of subframe si-logics. We introduce cofinal stable intuitionistic multi-conclusion consequence relations and cofinal stable si-logics, thus answering the question of what the analogues of cofinal subframe logics should be. This is done by utilizing the \$\$\{({\textbackslash}wedge,{\textbackslash}vee,{\textbackslash}neg)\}\$\$-reduct of Heyting algebras.

The variety of bounded distributive lattices is generated by the ?-free reducts of Heyting algebras, while the variety of implicative semilattices is generated by the ?-free reducts. Each of these reducts gives rise to canonical formulas that generalize Jankov formulas and provide an axiomatization of all superintuitionistic logics (si-logics for short). The ?-free reducts of Heyting algebras give rise to the (?,?)-canonical formulas that we studied in an earlier work. Here we introduce the (?,?)-canonical formulas, which are obtained from the study of the ?-free reducts of Heyting algebras. We prove that every si-logic is axiomatizable by (?,?)-canonical formulas. We also discuss the similarities and differences between these two kinds of canonical formulas. One of the main ingredients of these formulas is a designated subset D of pairs of elements of a finite subdirectly irreducible Heyting algebra A. When D=A2, we show that the (?,?)-canonical formula of A is equivalent to the Jankov formula of A. On the other hand, when D=Ø, the (?,?)-canonical formulas produce a new class of si-logics we term stable si-logics. We prove that there are continuum many stable si-logics and that all stable si-logics have the finite model property. We also compare stable si-logics to splitting and subframe si-logics.},

  abstract   = {This paper presents a new technique for handling modal logics with transitive frames, i.e. extensions of the modal system K4. In effect, the technique is based on the following fundamental result, to be obtained below in §3.Given a formula f, we can effectively construct finite frames 1, …, n which completely characterize the set of all transitive general frames refuting f. More exactly, an arbitrary general frame  refutes f iff  contains a (not necessarily generated) subframe  such that (1) i, for some i ? \{1, …, n\}, is a p-morphic image of  (after Fine [1985] we say  is subreducible to i), (2)  is cofinal in , and (3) every point in  that is not in  does not get into “closed domains” which are uniquely determined in i, by f.This purely technical result has, as it turns out, rather unexpected and profound consequences. For instance, it follows at once that if f determines no closed domains in the frames 1, …, n associated with it, then the normal extension of K4 generated by f has the finite model property and so is decidable. Moreover, every normal logic axiomatizable by any (even infinite) set of such formulas f also has the finite model property. This observation would not possibly merit any special attention, were it not for the fact that the class of such logics contains almost all the standard systems within the field of K4 (at least all those mentioned by Segerberg [1971] or Bull and Segerberg [1984]), all logics containing S4.3, all subframe logics of Fine [1985], and a continuum of other logics as well.},

Written by Georgian mathematician Leo Esakia, the text provedpopular among Russian-speaking logicians. This translation helps make the ideasaccessible to a wider audience and pays tribute to an influential mind in mathematicallogic. The book discusses the theory of Heyting algebras and closure algebras, aswell as the corresponding intuitionistic and modal logics. The author introduces thekey notion of a hybrid that “crossbreeds” topology (Stone spaces) and order (Kripkeframes), resulting in the structures now known as Esakia spaces. The main theoremsinclude a duality between the categories of closure algebras and of hybrids, and a dualitybetween the categories of Heyting algebras and of so-called strict hybrids.Esakia’s book was originally published in 1985. It was the first of a planned two-volume monographon Heyting algebras. But after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the publishing houseclosed and the project died with it. Fortunately, this important work now lives on inthis accessible translation. The Appendix of the book discusses the planned contentsof the lost second volume.},

For any calculus ? we denote by ?? the set of all formulae of the calculus ? and by ??? the lattice of all logics that are the extensions of the logic of the calculus ?, i.e. sets of ?? formulae containing the axioms of ? and closed with respect to its rules of inference. In the logic l ???G the sign ? is decoded as follows: \${\textbackslash}square A=(A{\textbackslash}\&{\textbackslash}Delta A)\$. The result of placing ? in the formula A before each of its subformula is denoted by TrA. The maps are defined: ls = Grz + \{TrA{\textbar} A ? l\}, l? = G + \{TrA{\textbar} A ? l\}, l? = \{A ? ?\$I{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}Delta\}\${\textbar} TrA ? l\}, \$l{\textbackslash}nabla \$ = l n ?I, l µ = \{A ? ?Grz{\textbar}A ? l\} (in the difinitions of ?? and ? the decoding of ? is meant), by virtue of which the diagram is constructed: In this diagram the maps s, ? and ? are isomorphisms, therefore \${\textbackslash}chi {\textasciicircum}\{-1\}={\textbackslash}lambda \$; and the maps \${\textbackslash}nabla \$ and µ are the semilattice epimorphisms that are not commutative with lattice operation +. Besides, the given diagram is commutative, and the next equalities take place: \${\textbackslash}sigma {\textasciicircum}\{-1\}={\textbackslash}mu {\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}lambda {\textbackslash}nabla \$ and \${\textbackslash}sigma ={\textbackslash}nabla {\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}chi {\textbackslash}mu \$. The latter implies in particular that any superintuitionistic logic is a superintuitionistic fragment of some proof logic extension.},

In order to give a unified treatment of this rather diverse body of material, Dr Johnstone begins by developing the theory of locales (a lattice-theoretic approach to 'general topology without points' which has achieved some notable results in the past ten years but which has not previously been treated in book form). This development culminates in the proof of Stone's Representation Theorem.},

  abstract  = {Heyting-Lewis Logic is the extension of intuitionistic propositional logic with a strict implication connective that satisfies the constructive counterparts of axioms for strict implication provable in classical modal logics. Variants of this logic are surprisingly widespread: they appear as Curry-Howard correspondents of (simple type theory extended with) Haskell-style arrows, in preservativity logic of Heyting arithmetic, in the proof theory of guarded (co)recursion, and in the generalization of intuitionistic epistemic logic.Heyting-Lewis Logic can be interpreted in intuitionistic Kripke frames extended with a binary relation to account for strict implication. We use this semantics to define descriptive frames (generalisations of Esakia spaces), and establish a categorical duality between the algebraic interpretation and the frame semantics. We then adapt a transformation by Wolter and Zakharyaschev to translate Heyting-Lewis Logic to classical modal logic with two unary operators. This allows us to prove a Blok-Esakia theorem that we then use to obtain both known and new canonicity and correspondence theorems, and the finite model property and decidability for a large family of Heyting-Lewis logics.},

  abstract  = {Nez Perce is a language with a dedicated comparative morpheme and crisp judgments in its comparatives, but with no means to express differential measurement in its comparative. These data can be captured by two different types of analyses: either Nez Perce has a negative setting of the Degree Semantics Parameter ([±DSP]) (Beck et al., 2009), along with a comparative operator that allows manipulation of context (Klein, 1980), or it has a positive setting of said parameter, but the comparative operator does not provide a slot for a differential degree argument. We show that the “degreeless” analysis of gradable adjectives in Nez Perce provides a unified and simple explanation for a cluster of additional properties of the language. At the same time, our findings draw attention to hitherto unattested variation within degreeless languages: other [-DSP] languages like Motu (Beck et al., 2009), Washo (Bochnak, 2015) and Warlpiri (Bowler, 2016) lack the Klein-style comparative operator present in Nez Perce.},

  abstract   = {This dissertation argues that modal expressions and gradable expressions in English can and should be treated using the same semantic apparatus. The formal theory that I develop is closely related to standard theories of gradability, comparison, and measurement which are built on abstract degrees. However, I show that certain issues are clarified by taking an (essentially equivalent) algebraic perspective which derives degrees from structures built around binary orders. This approach, in turn, will allow us to pose new questions and derive new conclusions regarding the structures underlying epistemic, deontic, and bouletic modals.

  abstract   = {Systematic variation in form between semantic equivalents across languages is a key explanandum of linguistic theory. Two contrasting views of the role of lexical semantics in the analysis of such variation can be found in the literature: (1) uniformity, whereby lexical meaning is universal, and morphosyntactic variation arises from idiosyncratic differences in the inventory and phonological shape of language-particular functional material, and (2) transparency, whereby systematic variation in form arises from systematic variation in the meaning of basic lexical items. This volume contrasts these views as applied to the empirical domain of property concept sentences—sentences expressing adjectival predication and their translational equivalents across languages. Demonstrating that property concept sentences vary systematically between possessive and predicative form, the authors propose a transparentist analysis of this variation that links it to the lexical denotations of basic property concept lexemes. At the heart of the analysis are qualities: mass-like model-theoretic objects that closely resemble scales. The authors contrast their transparentist analysis with uniformitarian alternatives, demonstrating its theoretical and empirical advantages. They then show that the proposed theory of qualities can account for interesting and novel observations in two central domains of grammatical theory: the theory of lexical categories, and the theory of mass nouns. The overall results highlight the importance of the lexicon as a locus of generalizations about the limits of crosslinguistic variation.},

On my reading, Gomez-Torrente accepts (a) and (b) while interpreting the identity statement as correctly attributing vague identity to the pair consisting of the vague natural kind water and the related kind H2O. My discussion sketches a framework for making sense talk of vague objects, properties, and identities that seems to fit his discussion. Next I focus on his treatment of a problem posed by seemingly conflicting perceptual reports of secondary qualities, like being hot, or red, made by equally competent observers. Since the observers are equally competent, it is hard to explain the apparent inconsistency. Whereas Gomez-Torrente treats the reports as so fine-grained as not to conflict, I suggest dispensing with ultrafine-grained semantic contextual parameters in favor of richer pragmatic parameters determining negotiated asserted contents. Next I question whether his plausible individually sufficient but not disjunctively necessary rules for uses of names and demonstratives should be understood as providing speaker referents versus contributions to illocutionary contents of uses of sentences containing those terms. Finally, I explain why I take the crowning jewel of the book to be the account in chapter 4 of natural numbers as plural cardinality properties, and of verbal, and Arabic, numerals as Millian names of those properties, the referents of which are fixed by genuinely semantic reference-fixing expressions.},

  abstract  = {On a now orthodox view, humans and many other animals possess a “number sense,” or approximate number system (ANS), that represents number. Recently, this orthodox view has been subject to numerous critiques that question whether the ANS genuinely represents number. We distinguish three lines of critique—the arguments from congruency, confounds, and imprecision—and show that none succeed. We then provide positive reasons to think that the ANS genuinely represents numbers, and not just non-numerical confounds or exotic substitutes for number, such as “numerosities” or “quanticals,” as critics propose. In so doing, we raise a neglected question: numbers of what kind? Proponents of the orthodox view have been remarkably coy on this issue. But this is unsatisfactory since the predictions of the orthodox view, including the situations in which the ANS is expected to succeed or fail, turn on the kind(s) of number being represented. In response, we propose that the ANS represents not only natural numbers (e.g. 7), but also non-natural rational numbers (e.g. 3.5). It does not represent irrational numbers (e.g. v2), however, and thereby fails to represent the real numbers more generally. This distances our proposal from existing conjectures, refines our understanding of the ANS, and paves the way for future research.},

However, during the last several decades, numerals proved to be a rich source of debate in linguistics, especially in semantics and pragmatics. The reason is that the study of numerals requires taking into account core issues such as plurality, quantification, implicature/exhaustivity, degree, modality, imprecision and cross-linguistic variation. In this article, we provide a thorough introduction to the issues connected to numeral semantics and pragmatics. We gradually develop analyses of meanings of numerals in natural language using a multitude of analytical tools. We evaluate the competing proposals in terms of empirical coverage and predictions.},

Opposed to the Traditional View is a thesis known as the Universal Density of Measurement: there is no fundamental semantic distinction between counting and measuring, and all natural language scales are dense. This paper considers a new argument for the latter, based on a puzzle I call the Fractional Cardinalities Puzzle: if answers to ‘how many’-questions always designate cardinalities, and if cardinalities are necessarily discrete, then how can e.g. ‘2.38’ be a correct answer to the question ‘How many ounces of water are in the beaker?’? If cardinality scales are dense, then the answer is obvious: ‘2.38’ designates a fractional cardinality, contra the Traditional View. However, I provide novel evidence showing that ‘many’ is not uniformly associated with the dimension of cardinality across contexts, and so ‘how many’-questions can ask about other kinds of measures, including e.g. volume. By combining independently motivated analyses of cardinal adjectives, measure phrases, complex fractions, and degrees, I develop a semantics intended to defend the Traditional View against purported counterexamples like this and others which have received a fair amount of recent philosophical attention.},

The analysis of such readings is controversial. One prominent approach assumes they are a symptom of many and few making reference to a context dependent standard of comparison. We observe that this initially attractive approach systematically undergenerates, failing to capture pervasive reverse proportionality in environments that remove context dependency of the standard. Instead, we propose that reverse proportionality in such cases can arise from the underspecification of the measure function underlying the meanings of many and few.},

  abstract   = {An argument that complex cardinals are not extra-linguistic but built using standard syntax and standard principles of semantic composition.In Cardinals, Tania Ionin and Ora Matushansky offer a semantic and syntactic analysis of nominal expressions containing complex cardinals (for example, two hundred and thirty-five books). They show that complex cardinals are not an extra-linguistic phenomenon (as is often assumed) but built using standard syntax and standard principles of semantic composition. Complex cardinals can tell us as much about syntactic structure and semantic composition as other linguistic expressions.Ionin and Matushansky show that their analysis accounts for the internal composition of cardinal-containing constructions cross-linguistically, providing examples from more than fifteen languages. They demonstrate that their proposal is compatible with a variety of related phenomena, including modified numerals, measure nouns, and fractions. Ionin and Matushansky show that a semantic or syntactic account that captures the behavior of a simplex cardinal (such as five) does not automatically transfer to a complex cardinal (such as five thousand and forty-six) and propose a compositional analysis of complex cardinals. They consider the lexical categories of simplex cardinals and their role in the construction of complex cardinals; examine in detail the numeral systems of selected languages, including Slavic and Semitic languages; discuss linguistic constructions that contain cardinals; address extra-linguistic conventions on the construction of complex cardinals; and, drawing on data from Modern Hebrew, Basque, Russian, and Dutch, show that modified numerals and partitives are compatible with their analysis.},

  abstract  = {Blame is a reaction to something of negative normative significanceabout someone or their behavior. A paradigm case, perhaps, would bewhen one person wrongs another, and the latter responds withresentment and a verbal rebuke, but of course we also blame others fortheir attitudes and characters (see, e.g., Smith 2005). Thus blamingscenarios typically involve a wide range of inward and outwardresponses to a wrongful or bad action, attitude, or character (suchresponses include: beliefs, desires, expectations, emotions,sanctions, and so on). In theorizing about blame, then, philosophershave typically asked two questions:, Many theorists approach these questions with a larger theoreticalagenda in mind: for example, in an effort to understand the conditionsof moral responsibility more generally and the nature of freedom(e.g., Wallace 1994), or in an effort to articulate the content ofmoral properties (e.g., Gibbard 1990). But the questions areinteresting in their own right, especially since blame is such acommon feature of moral experience. This entry will critically discussthe answers that have been offered in response to the above questionsconcerning blame, with the aim of shedding some light on blame’snature, ethics, and significance. (A common but by no means universalassumption is that praise is the counterpart of blame; still, it isblame that is often taken to be the more significant phenomenon formoral philosophy.)},

One source of this richness is the inherent non-monotonicity of its negation, something that does not have close parallels with the machinery of other programming paradigms. Nonetheless, much of the work on logic programming semantics seems to exist side by side with similar work done for imperative and functional programming, with relatively minimal contact between communities. In this paper we summarize one variety of approaches to the semantics of logic programs: that based on fixpoint theory. We do not attempt to cover much beyond this single area, which is already remarkably fruitful. We hope readers will see parallels with, and the divergences from the better known fixpoint treatments developed for other programming methodologies.},

In the present paper we generalise this result to arbitrary modal logics and we also show that a modal logic permits the existence of a homophonic theory of truth if and only if it permits the definition of a so-called master modality. Moreover, we explore a connection between the master modality and hybrid logic: We show that if attention is restricted to bidirectional frames, then the expressive power of the master modality is exactly what is needed to translate the bounded fragment of first-order logic into hybrid logic in a truth preserving way. We believe that this throws new light on Arthur Prior's fourth grade tense logic.},

  abstract  = {We introduce a framework for a graph-theoretic analysis of the semantic paradoxes. Similar frameworks have been recently developed for infinitary propositional languages by Cook [5, 6] and Rabern, Rabern, and Macauley [16]. Our focus, however, will be on the language of first-order arithmetic augmented with a primitive truth predicate. Using Leitgeb’s [14] notion of semantic dependence, we assign reference graphs (rfgs) to the sentences of this language and define a notion of paradoxicality in terms of acceptable decorations of rfgs with truth values. It is shown that this notion of paradoxicality coincides with that of Kripke [13]. In order to track down the structural components of an rfg that are responsible for paradoxicality, we show that any decoration can be obtained in a three-stage process: first, the rfg is unfolded into a tree, second, the tree is decorated with truth values (yielding a dependence tree in the sense of Yablo [21]), and third, the decorated tree is re-collapsed onto the rfg. We show that paradoxicality enters the picture only at stage three. Due to this we can isolate two basic patterns necessary for paradoxicality. Moreover, we conjecture a solution to the characterization problem for dangerous rfgs that amounts to the claim that basically the Liar- and the Yablo graph are the only paradoxical rfgs. Furthermore, we develop signed rfgs that allow us to distinguish between ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ reference and obtain more fine-grained versions of our results for unsigned rfgs.},

We state an answer in terms of dependence: those sentences which depend directly or indirectly on non-semantic states of affairs (only). In order to make this precise we introduce a theory of dependence according to which a sentence φ is said to depend on a set Φ of sentences iff the truth value of φ supervenes on the presence or absence of the sentences of Φ in/from the extension of the truth predicate. Both φ and the members of Φ are allowed to contain the truth predicate. On that basis we are able define notions such as ungroundedness or self-referentiality within a classical semantics, and we can show that there is an adequate definition of truth for the class of sentences which depend on non-semantic states of affairs.},

There is another category, however, at least as commonly associated with “blame,” which plays an important role in our relationships with others. This kind of blame, unlike Scanlon’s, is essentially connected to the appropriateness of such reactive emotions and sentiments as resentment, guilt, indignation, and righteous anger. Moreover, this kind of blame does not necessarily indicate an impairment of relationship. The paper further suggests that this kind of blame may be relevant to restorative approaches to criminal justice and that this kind of blame is specifically at stake in the free will debate.},

However, there are infinitary versions of the paradoxes, such as Yablo's paradox, that do not involve this form of circularity. It remains an open question what relations of reference between collections of sentences afford the structure necessary for paradoxicality -- these are the so-called "dangerous" directed graphs. Building on Rabern, et. al (2013) we reformulate this problem in terms of fixed points of certain functions, thereby boiling it down to get a purely mathematical problem.},

  abstract  = {We make the following contributions to modal logics with propositional quantifiers and modal logics with comparative operators in this dissertation: • We define a general notion of normal modal logics with propositional quantifiers. We call them normal Π-logics. Then, as was done by Scrogg's theorem on extensions of the modal logic S5, we study in general the normal Π-logics extending S5. We show that they are all complete with respect to their algebraic semantics based on complete simple monadic algebras. We also show that the lattice formed by these logics is isomorphic to the lattice of the open sets of the disjoint union of two copies of the one-point compactification of N with the natural order topology. Further, we show how to determine the computability of normal Pi-logics extending S5Π. A corollary is that they can be of arbitrarily high Turing-degree. • Regarding the normal Π-logics extending the modal logic KD45, we identify two important axioms: Immod: □∀p(□p → p) and 4∀: ∀p□φ → □∀p□φ. We argue that when □ is interpreted as the belief operator, we should not accept Immod in the logic of belief while 4∀ is desirable in settings with full introspection. Then we provide algebraic semantics based on complete well-connected pseudo monadic algebras for Box and ∀p and show that with respect to these algebras, normal Π-logics extending KD45 and 4∀ with a finite list of formulas are complete. We also give a general completeness theorem for atomic complete well-connected pseudo monadic algebras and a sufficient condition for the decidability of logics obtained by classes of these algebras, atomic or not. A special case of these general theorems is that the normal Π-logic of serial, transitive, and Euclidean Kripke frames, that is, the Kripke frames validating KD45, is axiomatized by KD45, 4∀, Immod, and ∃p(p∧∀q(q → □(p → q))) together with the usual axioms and rules for propositional quantifiers, and this logic is decidable. Other than completeness and decidability, we also show that 4∀ is not in the smallest normal Π-logic extending KD45, using a countermodel based on a possible-world frame with propositional contingency, and that 4∀ is valid in any complete Boolean algebra expansion validating KD45. • For modal logics with comparative operators, we first provide an axiomatization of the logic of comparing the cardinality of sets, as defined by Cantor. The main technical contribution is the observation that in a purely comparative language, we can define finiteness well enough so that an axiomatization can be done by combining the logic of comparative cardinality for finite sets and the logic of comparative cardinality for infinite sets. Note that these two logics are very different: the former contains the axiom of qualitative additivity: {\textbar}A{\textbar} ≥ {\textbar}B{\textbar} iff {\textbar}A {\textbackslash} B{\textbar} ≥ {\textbar}B {\textbackslash} A{\textbar} but not the axiom of absorption: if {\textbar}A{\textbar} ≥ {\textbar}B{\textbar} and {\textbar}A{\textbar} ≥ {\textbar}C{\textbar} then {\textbar}A{\textbar} ≥ {\textbar}B ∪ C{\textbar}, while the latter does the opposite. • Then we consider modal logics for comparative imprecise probability. In these logics, comparisons are made according to a set of probability measures and can be intuitively read as either "at least as likely as" (symbolized by ≥) or "more likely than" (symbolized by {\textgreater}). We first disambiguate two interpretations of "more likely than" based on a set of probability measures and show that the stronger interpretation is not definable from "at least as likely as" while the weaker sense is. Then, we go on to axiomatize the logic of imprecise probability in a sequence of languages obtained by adding to the language with just "at least as likely as", one by one, the comparative operator {\textgreater} for "more likely than" (in the stronger sense), a unary operator ♢ for "possibly", and a binary operator {\textless}φ{\textgreater}ψ for "possibly φ, and after learning the truth of φ, ψ''. We also comment on the expressivity of these languages and the decidability of the logics in these languages. In particular, we show that many distinctive features of the imprecise probability approach of representing the doxastic states of agents, such as the problem of dilation, are observable at this purely comparative level. Finally, we add a pair of operators I+pφ and I–pφ, intuitively read, respectively, as "after learning the existence of an actually true new proposition, now named by p, φ", and "after learning the existence of an actually false new proposition, now named by p, φ".

  year      = {2021},
  isbn      = {9780429030208},
  abstract  = {In 1963 Prior proved a theorem that places surprising constraints on the logic of intentional attitudes, like ‘thinks that’, ‘hopes that’, ‘says that’ and ‘fears that’. Paraphrasing it in English, and applying it to ‘thinks’, it states: If, at t, I thought that I didn’t think a truth at t, then there is both a truth and a falsehood I thought at t.                This chapter explores a response to this paradox that exploits the opacity of attitude verbs, exemplified in this case by the operator ‘I thought at t that’, to block Prior’s derivation. According to this picture, both Leibniz’s law and existential generalization fail in opaque contexts. In particular, one cannot infer from the fact that I’m thinking at t that I’m not thinking a truth at t, that there is a particular proposition such that I am thinking it at t. Moreover, unlike some approaches to this paradox (see Bacon et al., 2016) the failure of existential generalization is not motivated by the idea that certain paradoxical propositions do not exist, for this view maintains that there is a proposition that I’m not thinking a truth at t. Several advantages of this approach over the non-existence approach are discussed, and models demonstrating the consistency of this theory are provided. Finally, the resulting considerations are applied to the liar paradox, and are used to provide a non-standard justification of a classical gap theory of truth. One of the main challenges for this sort of theory—to explain the point of assertion, if not to assert truths—can be met within this framework.},

  year      = {1990},
  abstract  = {Quantification over propositions is a necessary component of any theory of attitudes capable of providing a semantics of attitude ascriptions and a sophisticated system of reasoning about attitudes. There appear to be two general approaches to propositional quantification. One is developed within a first order quantificational language, the other in the language of higher order logic. The first order theory is described in Asher \& Kamp (1986), Asher (1988), Asher and Kamp (1989). This paper concentrates on propositional quantification in a higher order framework, the simple theory of types. I propose a method of resolving difficulties noticed by Prior and Thomason with propositional quantification. The method borrows from Kripke's (1975) defintition of truth and results in a partial logic, which I call the simple theory ofpartial types (SPT). SPT offers a tractable, complete logic (with respect to general models) that includes propositional quantification, accomodates a semantics of the attitudes that avoids logical omniscience, and allows for some self-reference. Consider the following examples in which there is apparent quantification over propositions. 1 (1.a) Everything Mary believes is true.},

  abstract   = {For many, blame is a morally appropriate response only when the blamer has standing to blame. This chapter calls this the standard account, and this chapter argues that it should be rejected. Defenders of the standard account have articulated several conditions that a person must meet in order to have standing. This chapter considers arguments given in support of each condition and show that these arguments are vulnerable to objections. Despite the criticisms, this chapter acknowledges that there is a kernel of truth in the standard account: blame is positional; that is, blame’s moral propriety sometimes depends on the relationship between the blamer and the target. However, the standard account fails to adequately capture the positionality of blame. Despite what some philosophers suggest, the ethics of blame is not exhausted by considerations of fittingness and standing. As critics, targets, and third parties, we have special responsibilities, and this chapter closes by describing these responsibilities.},

  abstract  = {There are cases thought to illustrate that appropriate blame requires special standing. One might lack the standing to blame another because the fault is private and one is a stranger or because one is guilty of the very same offense and so one’s blame would be hypocritical. But despite its prevalence as an explanation of what goes wrong in such cases, the standing to blame itself has been given relatively little attention. The aim of this paper is to cast doubt on the standing to blame. It considers a range of plausible interpretations and, finding each wanting, concludes that those who wish to endorse the standing to blame owe us more by way of a characterization and defense. In raising this challenge, the paper motivates an alternative explanation of the cases.},

In the course of reconstructing the system, I draw attention to several of its features that are rarely remarked about, such as its punctuation-free notation, the status of the premisses of an argument as something intermediate between a set and a sequence of propositions, the incorrectness of the almost universal translation of the Greek label for the primitives of the system as indemonstrable arguments, the probable existence of an extended set of primitives which accommodates conjunctions with more than two conjuncts and disjunctions with more than two disjuncts, the basis for the system’s exclusion of redundant premisses, and the reason why the hypothetical syllogisms of Theophrastus are not derivable in the system. I argue that, though sound according to its originator’s (Chrysippus’s) conception of validity, the system as reconstructed is not complete according to that conception. It is an open problem what one needs to add to the system in order to make it Chrysippean-complete, or even whether it is possible to do so without making it Chrysippean-unsound.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  abstract  = {The Stoics are famously committed to the thesis that only bodies are, and for this reason they are rightly called “corporealists.” They are also famously compared to Plato’s earthborn Giants in the Sophist , and rightly so given their steadfast commitment to body as being. But the Stoics also notoriously turn the tables on Plato and coopt his “ dunamis proposal” that being is whatever can act or be acted upon, to underwrite their commitment to body rather than shrink from it as the Giants do. The substance of Stoic corporealism, however, has not been fully appreciated. This paper argues that Stoic corporealism goes beyond the dunamis proposal, which is simply an ontological criterion for being , to the metaphysics of body. This involves, first, an account of body as metaphysically simple and hence fundamental; second, an account of body as malleable and continuous, hence fit for blending ( krasis di’ holou ) and composition. In addition, the metaphysics of body involves a distinction between this composition relation seen in the cosmology, and the constitution relation by which the four-fold schema called the Stoic Categories proceeds, e.g. the relation between a statue and its clay, or a fist and its underlying hand. It has not been appreciated that the cosmology and the Categories are distinct — and complementary — explanatory enterprises, the one accounting for generation and unity, the other taking those individuals once generated, and giving a mereological analysis of their identity and persistence conditions, kinds, and qualities. The result is an elegant division of Plato’s labor from the Battle of Gods and Giants. On the one hand, the Stoics rehabilitate the crude cosmology of the Presocratics to deliver generation and unity in completely corporeal terms, and that work is found in their Physics. On the other hand, they reform the Giants and “dare to corporealize,” delivering all manner of predication (from identity to the virtues), and that work is found in Stoic Logic. Recognizing the distinctness of these explanatory enterprises helps dissolve scholarly puzzles, and harmonizes the Stoics with themselves.},

These constructions ensure that the propositional minimal logic has the finite model property. Finally, we define and investigate bi-modal companions with non-normal modal operators for some relevant subminimal systems, and give infinite axiomatizations for these bi-modal companions.},

Under the assumption that the operators of such an algebra \$ {\textbackslash}cal A \$are completely additive, he showed that the completion of \$ {\textbackslash}cal A \$always exists and is unique up to isomorphisms over \$ {\textbackslash}cal A \$. Moreover, strictly positive equations are preserved under completions a strictly positive equation that holds in \$ {\textbackslash}cal A \$must hold in the completion of \$ {\textbackslash}cal A \$. In this paper we extend Monk’s preservation theorem by proving that certain kinds of Sahlqvist equations (as well as some other types of equations and implications) are preserved under completions. An example is given that shows that arbitrary Sahlqvist equations need not be preserved.},

  abstract  = {Number words have played a central role in debates about the relation between context and meaning for decades. While current analyses of these terms and the sentences in which they appear differ in their details, they typically agree that interpretations of sentences containing number words crucially involve pragmatic enrichment of a more basic meaning. In the first part of this chapter, I present a set of challenges for existing semantic and pragmatic accounts of number word meaning. In the second part, I develop and motivate a fully semantic and compositional analysis of scalar readings of sentences containing numerals, in which number words denote generalized quantifiers over degrees, and scalar readings arise through scopal interactions between number words and other constituents, rather than through pragmatic enrichment. The Classic Analysis The dominant view of number word meaning – or more accurately, the contribution of number words to sentence and utterance meaning – comes from Horn 1972: Numbers, then, or rather sentences containing them, assert lower-boundedness – at least n – and given tokens of utterances containing cardinal numbers may, depending on the context, implicate upper-boundedness – at most n – so that the number may be interpreted as denoting an exact quantity. (Horn 1972: 33).},

As obvious as these claims are, they can’t be accounted for on the most straightforward and familiar views of counting and the semantics of number words. I develop a view on which counting is a type of measuring. In particular, counting involves a specific measure function. I then analyze that function and show how it can account for the cases in which counting is sensitive to partiality, e.g. partial bagels.},

The data discussed reveal a *ABA pattern that restricts syncretism among these categories. Specifically, in the sequence pseudo-partitive, counting form and plural, only adjacent forms can be syncretic. I argue that the constraint can be derived from a particular morphosyntactic structure, where, following Borer (2005), mass nouns have the smallest structure, count nouns (found after numerals) are derived by dividing the mass into units, and plural is derived by restricting the count denotation to pluralities. The article further investigates how the relevant forms interact with case marking, and suggests that the forms should be organized into a two-dimensional paradigm space where syncretic forms occupy contiguous regions.},

  abstract  = {Richard Holton provides a unified account of intention, choice, weakness of will, strength of will, temptation, addiction, and freedom of the will. Drawing on recent psychological research, he argues that, rather than being the pinnacle of rationality, the central components of the will are there to compensate for our inability to make or maintain sound judgments. Choice is understood as the capacity to form intentions even in the absence of judgments of what action is best. Weakness of will is understood as the failure to maintain an intention, or more specifically, a resolution, in the face of temptation—where temptation typically involves a shift in judgment as to what is best, or in the case of addiction, a disconnection between what is judged best and what is desired. Strength of will is the corresponding ability to maintain a resolution, an ability that requires the employment of a particular faculty or skill. Finally, the experience of freedom of the will is traced to the experiences of forming intentions, and of maintaining resolutions, both of which require effortful activity from the agent.},

  abstract  = {Treating the existential quantification ∃νi as a diamond ♢i and the identity νi = νj as a constant δij, we study restricted versions of first order logic as if they were modal formalisms. This approach is closely related to algebraic logic, as the Kripke frames of our system have the type of the atom structures of cylindric algebras; the full cylindric set algebras are the complex algebras of the intended multidimensional frames called cubes.The main contribution of the paper is a characterization of these cube frames for the finite-dimensional case and, as a consequence of the special form of this characterization, a completeness theorem for this class. These results lead to finite, though unorthodox, derivation systems for several related formalisms, e.g. for the valid n-variable first order formulas, for type-free valid formulas and for the equational theory of representable cylindric algebras. The result for type-free valid formulas indicates a positive solution to Problem 4.16 of Henkin, Monk and Tarski [16].},

But the shop cannot be identified with the building, because it would remain the same shop if it moved to another building or if it became an e-store. Daniel Korman [2019] uses these two observations to argue that establishments are immaterial objects. However, all that follows is that establishments are not buildings. I argue that establishments are organisations or corporate agents that are constituted by people. This entails that they are material objects. Korman’s observations can be accommodated in terms of the further observation that corporate agents can but need not own or rent buildings.},

Instead, I argue that if the view is correct, it has important implications for the causal versus evidential decision-theory debate. First, it allows us to make rational sense of our seemingly divergent intuitions across the Smoking Lesion and The Psychopath Button cases. Second, it generates strong new arguments for preferring the causal approach to decision-theory over the evidential approach.},

This paper presents three ways one might integrate the core idea of flat plenitude, i.e., that every suitable condition or property has exactly one mereological fusion, with a tensed logical setting. All require a revised notion of mereological fusion. The candidates differ over how they conceive parthood to interact with existence in time, which connects to the distinction between endurance and perdurance. Similar issues arise for the integration of mereology with modality, and much of our discussion applies to this project as well.},

In the contemporary literature on grounding, much effort has been devoted to logically characterize the formal aspects of grounding, but a major hard problem remains: defining suitable grounding principles for universal and existential formulae. Indeed, several grounding principles for quantified formulae have been proposed, but all of them are exposed to paradoxes in some very natural contexts of application. We introduce in this paper a first-order formal system that captures the notion of grounding and avoids the paradoxes in a novel and non-trivial way. The system we present formally develops Bolzano’s ideas on grounding by employing Hilbert’s ε-terms and an adapted version of Fine’s theory of arbitrary objects.},

  abstract = {The Russell–Myhill theorem threatens a familiar structured conception of propositions according to which two sentences express the same proposition only if they share the same syntactic structure and their corresponding syntactic constituents share the same semantic value. Given the role of the principle of universal instantiation in the derivation of the theorem in simple type theory, one may hope to rehabilitate the core of the structured view of propositions in ramified type theory, where the principle is systematically restricted. We suggest otherwise. The ramified core of the structured theory of propositions remains inconsistent in ramified type theory augmented with axioms of reducibility. This is significant because reducibility has been thought to be perfectly consistent with the ramified approach to the intensional antinomies. Nor is the addition of reducibility to ramified type theory sufficient to restore other intensional puzzles such as Prior’s paradox or Kripke’s puzzle about time and thought.},

  abstract  = {This entry is about two kinds of circularity: objectcircularity, where an object is taken to be part of itself insome sense; and definition circularity, where a collection isdefined in terms of itself.  Instances of these two kinds ofcircularity are sometimes problematic, and sometimes not.  We areprimarily interested in object circularity in this entry, especiallyinstances which look problematic when one tries to model them in settheory.  But we shall also discuss circular definitions.,  The term non-wellfounded set refers to sets which containthemselves as members, and more generally which are part of aninfinite sequence of sets each term of which is an element of thepreceding set.  So they exhibit object circularity in a blatant way.Discussion of such sets is very old in the history of set theory, butnon-wellfounded sets are ruled out of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (thestandard theory) due to the Foundation Axiom (FA).  As it happens,there are alternatives to this axiom FA.  This entry is especiallyconcerned with one of them, an axiom first formulated by Marco Fortiand Furio Honsell in a 1983 paper.  It is now standard to call this principle theAnti-Foundation Axiom (AFA), following its treatment in aninfluential book written by Peter Aczel in 1988.,  The attraction of using AFA is that it gives a set of tools formodeling circular phenomena of various sorts.  These tools areconnected to important circular definitions, as we shall see.  Weshall also be concerned with situating both the mathematics and theunderlying intuitions in a broader picture, one derived from work incoalgebra.Incorporating concepts and results from category theory,coalgebra leads us to concepts such as corecursionand coinduction; these are in a sense duals to the morestandard notions of recursionand induction.,  The topic of this entry also has connections to work in game theory(the universal Harsanyi type spaces), semantics (especiallysituation-theoretic accounts, or others where a “world” is allowedto be part of itself), fractals sets and other self-similar sets, theanalysis of recursion, category theory, and the philosophical side ofset theory.},

Similar principles are suggested for disjunction and universal quantification. Here, it is shown that these principles are jointly inconsistent: They require that there is a distinct truth for any plurality of truths. By a variant of Cantor’s Theorem, such a fine-grained individuation of truths is inconsistent. This shows that the notion of grounding is either not in good standing, or that natural assumptions about it need to be revised.},

  abstract  = {Inspired by the supervenience-determined consequence relation and the semantics of agreement operator, we introduce a modal logic of supervenience, which has a dyadic operator of supervenience as a sole modality. The semantics of supervenience modality very naturally correspond to the supervenience-determined consequence relation, in a quite similar way that the strict implication corresponds to the inference-determined consequence relation. We show that this new logic is more expressive than the modal logic of agreement, by proposing a notion of bisimulation for the latter. We provide a sound proof system for the new logic. We lift onto more general logics of supervenience. Related to this, we address an interesting open research direction listed in the literature, by comparing propositional logic of determinacy and noncontingency logic in expressive powers and axiomatizing propositional logic of determinacy over various classes of frames. We also obtain an alternative axiomatization for propositional logic of determinacy over universal models.},

  abstract  = {Predicativity is a notable example of fruitful interaction between philosophy and mathematical logic. It originated at the beginning of the 20th century from methodological and philosophical reflections on a changing concept of set. A clarification of this notion has prompted the development of fundamental new technical instruments, from Russell’sRussell, Bertrand type theory to an important chapter in proof theory, which saw the decisive involvement of KreiselKreisel, Georg, Feferman and SchütteSchütte, Kurt. The technical outcomes of predicativity have since taken a life of their own, but have also produced a deeper understanding of the notion of predicativity, therefore witnessing the “light logic throws on problems in the foundations of mathematics.” [30, p. vii] Predicativity has been at the center of a considerable part of Feferman’s work: over the years he has explored alternative ways of explicating and analyzing this notion and has shown that predicativePredicative mathematics extends much further than expected within ordinary mathematics. The aim of this note is to outline the principal features of predicativity, from its original motivations at the start of the past century to its logical analysis in the 1950–1960s. The hope is to convey why predicativity is a fascinating subject, which has attracted Feferman’s attention over the years.},

  abstract  = {Ramification1 is fundamentally a theory of quantification. It says that no proposition can quantify over itself (or over propositions that can quantify over it, etc.).2 Slightly more carefully, so as to not assume that propositions themselves contain quantifiers, it says that that there is an infinite hierarchy of orders of propositions, and that if a sentence (or, even more carefully, a formula P) denotes a proposition of order n, quantifiers in the sentence (P) can range over only orders m {\textgreater} n. I often speak loosely of propositions themselves quantifying with the understanding that such talk can be avoided if necessary. I also assume, contrary to Russell’s version of ramification but in line with Church’s (Church, 1976), that orders are cumulative, so that propositions of order n also appear in all orders m {\textgreater} n.},

  abstract   = {\&quot;The hard won power ... to assess correctly the continuum of the natural numbers grew out of titanic struggles in the realm of mathematical logic in which Hermann Weyl took a leading part.\&quot; — John Archibald Wheeler Hermann Weyl (1885–1955) ranks among the most important mathematicians and physicists of this century. Though Weyl was not primarily a philosopher, his wide-ranging philosophical reflections on the formal and empirical sciences remain extremely valuable. Besides indicating clearly which results of classical analysis are invalidated by an important family of \&quot;non-circular\&quot; (predicative) theories, The Continuum wrestles with the problem of applying constructive mathematical models to cases of concrete physical and perceptual continuity. This new English edition features a personal reminiscence of Weyl written by John Archibald Wheeler. Originally published in German in 1918, the book consists of two chapters. Chapter One, entitled Set and Function, deals with property, relation and existence, the principles of the combination of judgments, logical inference, natural numbers, iteration of the mathematical process, and other topics. The main ideas are developed in this chapter in such a way that it forms a self-contained whole. In Chapter Two, The Concept of Numbers \&amp; The Continuum, Weyl systematically begins the construction of analysis and carries through its initial stages, taking up such matters as natural numbers and cardinalities, fractions and rational numbers, real numbers, continuous functions, curves and surfaces, and more. Written with Weyl\&\#39;s characteristic passion, lucidity, and wisdom, this advanced-level volume is a mathematical and philosophical landmark that will be welcomed by mathematicians, physicists, philosophers, and anyone interested in foundational analysis.},

That is, the standard, iterative approach to sets is extended to include properties, and then the resulting hierarchy of sets and properties is used to construct propositions. Propositions on this account are structured in the sense of mirroring the sentences that express them, and they would seem to serve the needs of philosophers of language and metaphysicians who rely on such propositions. The resulting account has limitations, comparable to those faced by the iterative approach to sets, but it is argued to be in important ways preferable to others that have been proposed.},

I first show that for any choice option, a, and for any state of the world, G, the measure of the choiceworthiness of a in G is the comparative utility (CU) of a in G—that is, the difference in utility, in G, between a and whichever alternative to a carries the greatest utility in G. On the basis of this principle, I then argue that for any agent, S, faced with any decision under risk, S should rank his or her decision options (in terms of how choiceworthy they are) according to their comparative expected comparative utility (CECU) and should choose whichever option carries the greatest CECU. For any option, a, a’s CECU is the difference between its ECU and that of whichever alternative to a carries the greatest ECU, where a’s ECU is a probability-weighted sum of a’s CUs across the various possible states of the world. I lastly demonstrate that in some ordinary decisions under risk, ECU theory delivers different verdicts from those of standard decision theory.},

Wedgwood motivates BT through what he terms Gandalf’s principle, that the merits of an action in a given state should be evaluated relative only to the performances of other actions in that state, and not to their performances in other states. Although BT succeeds in selecting intuitively rational actions in a number of cases—including some in which EDT or CDT seem to go wrong—it places constraints on rational decision-making that either lack motivation or are untenable. Specifically, I argue that as it stands BT is committed both to endorsing and rejecting the independence of irrelevant alternatives. Furthermore its requirement that weakly dominated actions be excluded from consideration of rational action lacks motivation and threatens to collide with traditional game theory. In the final section of the paper, I construct a counterexample to BT.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel concept of a Polyatomic Logic and initiates its systematic study. This approach, inspired by Inquisitive semantics, is obtained by taking a variant of a given logic, obtained by looking at the fragment covered by a selector term. We introduce an algebraic semantics for these logics and prove algebraic completeness. These logics are then related to translations, through the introduction of a number of classes of translations involving selector terms, which are noted to be ubiquitous in algebraic logic. In this setting, we also introduce a generalised Blok-Esakia theory which can be developed for special classes of translations. We conclude by showing some systematic connections between the theory of Polyatomic Logics and the general Blok-Esakia theory for a wide class of interesting translations.},

  abstract = {In "A Problem in Possible-World Semantics," David Kaplan presented a consistent and intelligible modal principle that cannot be validated by any possible world frame (in the terminology of modal logic, any neighborhood frame). However, Kaplan's problem is tempered by the fact that his principle is stated in a language with propositional quantification, so possible world semantics for the basic modal language without propositional quantifiers is not directly affected, and the fact that on careful inspection his principle does not target the world part of possible world semantics---the atomicity\&nbsp;of the algebra of propositions---but rather the idea of propositional quantification over a complete\&nbsp;Boolean algebra of propositions. By contrast, in this paper we present a simple and intelligible modal principle, without propositional quantifiers, that cannot be validated by any possible world frame precisely because of their assumption of atomicity (i.e., the principle also cannot be validated by any atomic Boolean algebra expansion). It follows from a theorem of David Lewis that our logic is as simple as possible in terms of modal nesting depth (two). We prove the consistency of the logic using a generalization of possible world semantics known as possibility semantics. We also prove the completeness of the logic (and two other relevant logics) with respect to possibility semantics. Finally, we observe that the logic we identify naturally arises in the study of Peano Arithmetic.},

In this work, an extension of the modal embedding to infinitary intuitionistic logic is introduced. First, a neighborhood semantics for a family of axiomatically presented infinitary modal logics is given and soundness and completeness are proved via the method of canonical models. The semantics is then exploited to obtain a labelled sequent calculus with good structural properties. Next, soundness and faithfulness of the embedding are established by transfinite induction on the height of derivations: the proof is obtained directly without resorting to non-constructive principles. Finally, the modal embedding is employed in order to relate classical, intuitionistic and modal derivability in infinitary logic extended with axioms.},

Hence, by duality, we also cover the usual method of adding propositional quantifiers to normal modal logics by considering their classes of Kripke frames. In addition, we obtain decidability for all the concrete logics we discuss.},

This shows that Stone duality can be obtained as a particular case of de Vries duality. We also introduce extremally disconnected de Vries algebras and show that the category of extremally disconnected de Vries algebras is dually equivalent to the category of extremally disconnected compact Hausdorff spaces. As a result, we give a simple construction of the Gleason cover of a compact Hausdorff space by means of de Vries duality. We also discuss the insight that Stone duality provides in better understanding of de Vries duality.},

We suggest that Russell’s paradox is best regarded as a limitative result on propositional granularity. Some propositions are, on pain of contradiction, unable to discriminate between classes with different members: whatever they predicate of one, they predicate of the other. When accepted, this remarkable fact should cast some doubt upon some of the uses to which modern descendants of Russell’s paradox of propositions have been put in recent literature.},

The authors' previous book served as the main reference for introductory courses on lambda-calculus for over 20 years: this version is thoroughly revised and offers an account of the subject with the same authoritative exposition. The grammar and basic properties of both combinatory logic and lambda-calculus are discussed, followed by an introduction to type-theory. Typed and untyped versions of the systems, and their differences, are covered. Lambda-calculus models, which lie behind much of the semantics of programming languages, are also explained in depth. The treatment is as non-technical as possible, with the main ideas emphasized and illustrated by examples. Many exercises are included, from routine to advanced, with solutions to most at the end of the book.},

Recently, several authors have argued that those wishing to treat normative uncertainty differently from descriptive uncertainty face a dependence problem because one's descriptive uncertainty can depend on one's normative uncertainty. The aim of this paper is to determine whether the phenomenon of dependence poses a decisive problem for Excluders. I argue that existing arguments fail to show this, and that, while stronger ones can be found, Excluders can escape them.},

We need instead to ask about the relation between intention and partial belief. An account of partial belief that is more psychologically realistic than the standard credence account is developed. A notion of partial intention is then developed, standing to all-out intention much as partial belief stands to all-out belief. Various coherence constraints on the notion are explored. It is concluded that the primary relations between intention and belief should be understood as normative and not essential.},

The obtained language ℒc proves to have a great expressive power. It is equivalent with respect to modal definability to another enrichment ℒ() ofℒ, whereis an additional modality with the semanticsx ⊧ϕ iff āy(y⊧ x → y ⊧ϕ). Model-theoretic characterizations of modal definability in these languages are obtained. Further we consider deductive systems in ℒc. Strong completeness of the normal ℒc-logics is proved with respect to models in which all worlds are named. Every ℒc-logic axiomatized by formulae containing only names (but not propositional variables) is proved to be strongly frame-complete. Problems concerning transfer of properties ([in]completeness, filtration, finite model property etc.) fromℒ to ℒcare discussed. Finally, further perspectives for names in multimodal environment are briefly sketched.},

Standard modal logics use modalities for talking about the relations in relational structure. Hybrid logics are extensions of standard modal logics, involving symbols that name individual states in models. Hybrid logic arises when mechanisms for naming and asserting identity of worlds are added; to give an analogy, they are to standard modal systems what first-order languages with equality are to equality-free languages. The chapter provides an overview of the field of hybrid logic and presents a coherent picture of the current state of affairs in the field of hybrid logic. The most important techniques and results in the field, with respect to completeness, expressive power, frame definability, interpolation, and complexity are discussed. The proof systems for hybrid languages such as sequents, natural deduction, or tableaux, and some issues concerning the development of automated provers based on them are also described.},

Various questions are formulated and settled within the framework, including questions about the ordering of necessities under strength, the existence of broadest necessities satisfying various logical conditions, and questions about their logical behaviour. We also wield the framework to probe the conditions under which a logicist account of necessities is possible, in which the theory is completely reducible to logic.},

  abstract  = {The principle of modal ubiquity-that every truth is necessary or contingent-and the validity of possibility introduction, are principles that any modal theory suffers for failing to accommodate. Advanced modal claims are modal claims about entities other than spatiotemporally unified individuals (perhaps, then, spatiotemporally disunified individuals, sets, numbers, properties, propositions and events). I show that genuine modal realism, as it has thus far been explicitly developed, and in so far as it deals with advanced modal claims, cannot accommodate the principles in question. On behalf of the genuine modal realist I motivate and propose a redundancy interpretation of advanced possibility claims and extend that interpretation to the cognate cases of necessity, impossibility and contingency. I then show that the problematic principles as they apply to advanced modal claims can be derived from these interpretations. I show further how the proposed interpretation enables the genuine modal realist to deal with a number of objections that centre on the alleged inadequacy of the genuine modal realist's expressive resources. I conclude that genuine modal realism emerges the stronger for having been shown capable of dealing with advanced modal claims on the basis of no conceptual and ontological resources beyond those it requires to deal with ordinary modal claims.},

This is the problem of advanced modalizing. Divers (1999, 2002) presents a principled solution to this problem by treating modal modifiers as semantically redundant in some such cases. However, this semantic move does not deal adequately with advanced de re modal claims. Here, we motivate and detail a comprehensive semantics (a la Lewis 1968) for advanced modalizing de dicto and de re. The generalized semantic feature of the initial solution is not redundancy but absence from counterpart-theoretic translations of world-constrictions.},

  abstract = {An important motivation for believing in the modal realist’s ontology of other concrete possible worlds and their inhabitants is its theoretical utility, centrally the reduction of ordinary modal talk to counterpart theory as showcased by David Lewis’s 1968 translation scheme. In a recent paper Harold Noonan, following the lead of John Divers, argues that Lewis’s scheme is not strictly adequate by the modal realist’s own lights, and that nothing short of jettisoning de dicto contingency will help. In this paper, I argue that this is a serious overreaction. First, I show that Noonan’s problem does not touch Lewis’s proposal, since his translation scheme is not even concerned with the relevant sentences. Thus, Noonan’s problem only points to a limit in scope. I then go on to propose a straightforward extension of the translation scheme that provides translations for the allegedly problematic sentences, but does so endangering neither adequacy nor de dicto contingency.},

No mathematical skills are assumed, with all concepts and results explained in non-technical and intuitive as well as more formal ways. There are now over 140 exercises with solutions, along with a glossary of key terms and concepts. This second edition includes a new chapter on risk aversion as well as updated discussions of numerous central ideas, including Newcomb's problem, prisoner's dilemmas, and Arrow's impossibility theorem. The book will appeal particularly to philosophy students but also to readers in a range of disciplines, from computer science and psychology to economics and political science.},

The view that is presented is applied to Davidson’s criterion of identity for events and to the structuralist criterion of identity of places in a structure.},

On the other hand, Arthur Prior had observed in Prior (1961) that on pain of contradiction, ∀p(Qp →¬p) is Q only if one true proposition is Q and one false proposition is Q. The two observations are related: ∀p(Qp →¬p) is elusive in that it is not possible for the proposition to be uniquely Q. Kaplan based his model-theoretic observation on Cantor’s theorem, but there is a less well-known link between this simple set-theoretic observation and Prior’s remark. We generalize the link to develop a heuristic designed to move from Cantor’s theorem to the observation that a variety of sentences of the bimodal language express propositions that cannot be Q uniquely. We highlight the analogy between some of these results and some set-theoretic antinomies and suggest that the phenomenon is richer than one may have anticipated.},

  abstract   = {No one has figured more prominently in the study of the German philosopher Gottlob Frege than Michael Dummett. His magisterial Frege: Philosophy of Language is a sustained, systematic analysis of Frege's thought, omitting only the issues in philosophy of mathematics. In this work Dummett discusses, section by section, Frege's masterpiece The Foundations of Arithmetic and Frege's treatment of real numbers in the second volume of Basic Laws of Arithmetic, establishing what parts of the philosopher's views can be salvaged and employed in new theorizing, and what must be abandoned, either as incorrectly argued or as untenable in the light of technical developments.Gottlob Frege (1848-1925) was a logician, mathematician, and philosopher whose work had enormous impact on Bertrand Russell and later on the young Ludwig Wittgenstein, making Frege one of the central influences on twentieth-century Anglo-American philosophy; he is considered the founder of analytic philosophy. His philosophy of mathematics contains deep insights and remains a useful and necessary point of departure for anyone seriously studying or working in the field.},

The possibility of such disputes undermines an argument mobilized by relativists such as Lasersohn (Linguist Philos 28:643–686, 2005) and MacFarlane (Philos Stud 132:17–31, 2007) against contextualism about aesthetic terminology. In describing the facts of aesthetic disagreement, I distinguish between the intuition of dispute on the one hand and the felicity of denial on the other. Considered separately, neither of those phenomena requires that there be a single proposition asserted by one party to an aesthetic dispute and denied by the other. I suggest instead that many such disputes be analyzed as disputes over the selection or appropriateness of a contextually salient aesthetic standard.},

In particular, I argue that those who reject the necessity of distinctness have natural solutions to various paradoxes of recombination which have plagued the metaphysics of modality. Moreover, I argue that adding the necessity of distinctness to modest, paradox-free assumptions is sufficient to reinstate the paradoxes. Given that identity is non-contingent only if distinctness is necessary, I suggest this constitutes new evidence against the non-contingency of identity.},

The semantics of exceptives is primarily one of subtraction from the domain of a quantifier. The crucial semantic difference between the highly grammaticized but-phrases and free exceptives is that the former have the Uniqueness Condition as part of their lexical meaning whereas the latter are mere set subtractors. Several empirical differences between the two types of exceptives are shown to follow from this basic lexical difference.},

Our analysis yields two new types of modal result. First, we obtain complete logics for concrete mechanisms of belief revision, based on compositional reduction axioms. Next, we show how various abstract postulates for belief revision can be analyzed by standard modal frame correspondences for model-changing operations.},

  abstract = {The question of what a group of rational agents would agree on were they to deliberate on how to organise society is central to all hypothetical social contract theories. If morality is to be based on a social contract, we need to know the terms of this contract. One type of social contract theory, contractarianism, aims to derive morality from rationality alone. Contractarians need to show, amongst other things, that rational and self-interested individuals would agree on an impartial division of a cooperative surplus. But it is often claimed that contractarians cannot show this without introducing moral assumptions. This paper argues that on the right understanding of the question contractarians are asking, these worries can be answered. Without relying on moral assumptions, the paper offers a novel derivation of symmetry, which is the axiom responsible for the impartiality of the most famous economic bargaining solutions appealed to by contractarians.},
